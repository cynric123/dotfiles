Project goal is to create a platform for building shopping lists using REST API frameworks to manage and track shopping patterns. Planning stage consists of the following steps:

1. Choose programming language/backend framework.
2. Choose database type. 
3. Determine source of user input.

A detailed analysis of pros and cons is forthcoming, afterwards the three steps can be expanded.
