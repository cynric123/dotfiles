Practiced regex.

- TODO: complete regex to scan for valid IPv4 addresses.
- CTRL+K: enter digraph mode; access non-standard characters.
    - `:digraphs` brings up character chart.

Installed YouCompleteMe plugin for Vim.

- Changed keybinds for Ultisnips for compatibility.
- Set up .js TSserver for node integration.
- Uninstalled, replaced with coc.nvim.
