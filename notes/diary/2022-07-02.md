Added script `jreport` to compile the last 5 journal entries into a pdf.    

- Ripgrep current directory and all subdirectories for 5 of the last created markdown files, piping them into `cat` separated by a newline, and storing them into a text file containing the template pandoc.yaml.

    > `rg -t md --files | sort | head -5 | xargs -I{} sh -c "cat {}; echo ''" >> $journal_path/report.txt`

- Pandoc YAML header to handle text-wrapping for code.

    ```yaml
    ---
    header-includes:
    - \usepackage{fvextra}
    - \DefineVerbatimEnvironment{Highlighting}{Verbatim}{breaklines,commandchars=\\\{\}}
    ---
    ```

Installed wsl-open; xdg-open compatability.

- `wsl-open -h` for help, there is no man page.
