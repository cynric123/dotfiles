Updated notes system functioning.

- Added ctags support for markdown files.
- Placeholder .hg directory triggers gutentags.
- Created new directories with expanded scope.

Updated ctags regex syntax.

- .ctags.d directory placed in \$HOME; md.ctags file sets custom markdown tag generation rules that overwrites normal methods. (\$HOME/.ctags.d/md.ctags)
- Added code sets tag regex patterns for the following:
    - Any word after the @ symbol, but not urls.
    - Any string inside brackets with parenthesis immediately following.
