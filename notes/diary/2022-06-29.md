# Wednesday June 29th, 2022
Added documentation on English history. (history/england.md)

Added documentation on Linux documentation. (linux/useful_sites.md)

Improved file-system searching and tag management.

- File structure added to improve organization, links added to relevant files to reduce clutter.
- > `rg --hidden --files-with-matches '@alex'`
    - Returns all files containing the string `@alex`, marking the file as having been edited by me. Hidden files are included, i.e. dotfiles.
- Short script added to .zshrc to quickly create/edit today's note file.

    ```bash
    notes() {
        local year=$(date +"%Y")
        local month=$(date +"%m")
        local day=$(date +"%d")
        local file=$year-$month-$day
        vim "$HOME/notes/journal/$year/$month/$file.md"
    }
    ```

Updated pdf2bib.sh and added readme.

- Still in alpha; script is non-functional.
