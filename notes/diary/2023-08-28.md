# The Day I Discovered VimWiki 

I'm keeping this journal so that my progress can be tracked with more
tangible accuracy than what self-reflection alone can allow. My brain is
good for having ideas, not remembering them. Today marks the first entry,
I feel a 4/10 on the anxiety scale. A hurricane arrives tomorrow; Idalia,
a category 3, will likely cause massive storm surges along the west coast.
The only concern for us will be fallen trees and humid weather. After Ian,
massive devastation was wrought along the coast. I can imagine it will be
similar this time, but the trajectory places it closer to Tampa, and thus
our home.

This hurricane does not concern me. I wonder a little, that the depth of
human suffering beyond the fragile shield of my own personal social unit
could be so callously downgraded to be at best a minor affair, at worst an
inconvenience. Not too much wondering, because it is nothing new.
Additional information will be added as it becomes available.

Landfall ETA is Wednesday, August 30th. Current estimate is a category 3,
with rapid intensification after landfall.

## Mon Aug 28 20:22:16 2023 
Evacuations are underway along the coast; 10-15 foot surges are expected,
but we are far enough inland to remain safe. ETA continues as predicted.
