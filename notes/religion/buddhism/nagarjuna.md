# Are all things empty? - Nagarjuna & The Buddhist Middle Way: [link]

Nagarjuna's ideas were instrumental to Mahayana Buddhism's development during his lifetime, approximately the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE. To Nagarjuna, there is no ultimate reality or truth beyond the various forms of impermanence which compose it. To this end, Nagarjuna wrote the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā as vehicle to explain the nature of Śūnyatā by refuting the doctrines of Dharma found in the Abhidharmas. To understand how these things relate and what they mean, first we must start with the basics of Buddhism itself.

The core tenants of Buddhism are the Four Noble Truths, but more generally they are 'Anattā' and 'Dependent Arising'. The former is a deconstruction of self-identity into various 'aggregates', or 'skandha', and the latter is an assertion of universal interdependence. Most Buddhists deny the existence of an "Absolute Self" as one might say of the Newtonian model of the atom being indivisible only in the sheer tightness with which it's constituent aggregates are packed. This is a natural conclusion to come to if one seeks an atomized distillation of being; the very fact that our consciousness can be separated into interdependent fragments illustrates it's fragility, and thus impermanence.

### Śūnyatā
A Sanskrit word that means "emptiness", it is related to Anattā, but is more generalized. It is a central concept to Buddhist philosophy, and many traditions have developed the idea in different ways. Nagarjuna, and Mahayana Buddhism in general, use the word to relate the transient nature of all things and the nebulous boundaries which separate all things from each other.

Consider the flower growing a field. What is this flower without the environment which gave rise to it? Is there some core essence or nature of "flower-ness" by which the thing has inherent meaning? There is no such nature apart from semantics and abstraction. Without the soil, how can the flower spread it's roots? Without the air, how can the flower breathe and spread pollen? Material spreads in from without, and spreads out from within. The flower, therefore, is itself only an abstraction used conversationally; there is no "flower" apart from the many parts which mutually arise to facilitate it's form which we recognize linguistically.

### Abhidharma
Highly abstract and technical texts, they address the common principles of Buddhist philosophy, the impermanence of self and dependant arising. In addition to this, they discuss 'Dharmas', which are defined as fundamentally real, juxtaposed to the principle of 'Anattā'. Each Dharma has an intrinsic nature, and is independently real apart from all other Dharma, which are said to be the foundation upon which our reality is formed.

### Mūlamadhyamakakārikā
Nagarjuna's principal text; it means 'Root verses on the Middle Way', and is where his philosophy of 'The Middle Way' is first established. Two major themes which occupy the center of this philosophy are Śūnyatā and the 'Two Truths Doctrine'. The first is the principle of emptiness, the second a kind of buffer to provide context for the first in daily life by separating "conventional truths" from "ultimate truth".

To address Śūnyatā, Nagarjuna refutes the ideas of the Abhidharma, saying:

> "There being no dharma whatsoever that is not dependently originated, it follows that there is also no dharma whatsoever that is non-empty."

It is not that Nagarjuna argues for existential nihilism, or that nothing can have value or meaning, but that no such meaning or value arises apart from anything else in a fundamental or absolute sense. It is this absolute commitment to non-absoluteness that inspires Nagarjuna's profound philosophy.

> "Emptiness is not some kind of primordial reality, but a correction to a mistaken view of how the world exists." -Jan Cristoph Westerhoff

It is important to note that not even Śūnyatā is absolute, and this is the most crucial aspect of Buddhism to be grasped. While others might claim the four noble truths, Anattā, and dependent arising as the core tenants, ultimately the practical purpose of these philosophies is to deconstruct incorrect world-views built on tenuous logic and self-affirming biases. The power and value of Buddhism to add good to the world is found in subtracting the power and value of things which don't.

The 'Two Truths Doctrine' attempts to reconcile the human need for contextual narrative and the radical emptiness of Śūnyatā. Nagarjuna argues that all things are fundamentally without inherent meaning or essence, but this is clearly not a philosophy which alone inspires virtue and goodness. If Nirvana is not real, why do we seek awakening? If karma is not real, why do we experience cause and effect? If the four noble truths are ultimately just empty vessels for transient ideas, why would we bother with philosophy at all? Conventional truths, therefore, exist to provide the "ultimate truth" context. According to Nagarjuna, only Śūnyatā is worthy enough to claim anything close to "ultimate truth".
