# Frost Hollow

A Frost Hollow is the phenomenon of uniquely low temperatures found only
at depressions along certain terrain.[1] During the day, radiation from
the sun heats up the air, causing it to rise. This process of rising wind
stays active, even when the sun sets. The resulting lack of warm air
causes the colder air to become denser, and it flows downward across the
terrain. If the terrain folds downward into a hole, the air accumulates,
causing temperatures to drop below even the ones found at the highest
peaks. 

Normally, holes in climates with rain become eroded over time, as water
accumulates and flows down mountain slopes. If it resists erosion, it is
typically filled up by deposits of sediment left by the flowing water. An
exception is found with limestone; limestone is extremely permeable, and
this causes water to drain directly to bedrock through sinkholes and large
depressions, formed by erosion from within. Most of the water that lands
on such a depression will enter these caverns and continue to flow
downward. This is an example of how two different stone types in an
environment can interact, causing one to erode faster than another, which
leaves massive cavern systems behind as a result.
