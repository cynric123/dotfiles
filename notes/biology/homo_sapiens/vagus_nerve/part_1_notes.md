# Terms
Prolotherapy
* not enough studies to disprove
* injections in and around the vagus nerve
    * one proliferant is ozone

Vagus Nerve Stimulation
	* like a pacemaker for your vagus nerve
	* FDA approved for 3 conditions
		* epilepsy
            * addon therapy for focal seizures
			* not a cure, only reduces severity
		* depression
			* used after 4+ medication failures
			* loose correlation; only if no other options
		* stroke rehabilitation
			* arm/hand function loss due to isochemic stroke
			* highest correlation of improvement
	* dangerous for certain cases
		* heart arrythmia/cardiac abnormalities
		* pulmanory disease/breathing abnormalities
		* autonomic nervous system condition
		* schizophrenia
		* schizoaffective disorder
		* delusional disorders
		* rapid cycling bipolar disorder

Heart Rate Variability
	* measure heart rate stressors
	* sympathetic vs parasympathetic
		* survival vs growth/repair

# Aspects of Vagal Tone
Low vs high vagal tone
	* heartrate variability
	* vagus degeneration
		* structural inflamation
	* vagus regeneration
		* restorative

# Chronic Sickness and Neck Problems
Vagus nerve controls many sphincter actuations
	* stomach acid production
		* piloric valve
	* esophageal sphincter
	* vocal chords
	* sound dampening/sensitivity
		* eustacian tube/Levator veli palatini muscle

Compression and torsion of neck ligaments
	* sitting wrong
	* looking down or up for too long
Intestinal wall fortification
	* "leaky gut" caused by excessive permeability of gut epithelial cells
	* vagus nerve regulates intestinal wall permeability
		* inflamatory response to caustic agents regulated by vagus nerve
Vagus nerve shuts off and controls body stresses
	* degeneration manifests through systemic inflamation
	* Vagus nerve shuts off inflammation in the body
	* releases anti-inflammatory substances through spleen and digestive track

# Cervicovagothopy
Changes in the structure of the neck
	* loss of lordotic curve leads to vagus injury

# Studies
* immune interactions involved in cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway
    * DOI: 10.33549/physiolres.933671
