# 1491-1603 CE
Life of English king [Henry VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII), [Anne Boleyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Boleyn) and the English Reformation.

- Known for personal extravagance, excessive cruelty in punishment, chivalric chauvinism, and paranoid obsession.
- Anne, his second wife, is thought to have initiated the Reformation by her influence. Her education in France exposed her to renaissance ideas which would inform her expression of piety to oppose papal influence. He had her decapitated when, like his first wife, she failed to produce an heir.
    - Her only daughter, [Elizabeth I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I), did eventually become Queen, and ruled for 44 years.
- Reinitiated the tradition of "divine right of kings" to replace papal authority
