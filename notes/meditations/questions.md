What is it like to identify as an Arch-Angel?
- How do you feel about having this identity?
- How do you express this identity?
- Is this identity generative or performative?
    - Generative: arising naturally, i.e. being gay.
    - Performative: according to actions, i.e. being a leader.
- "Considering the nature of this distinction, how would you approach
  models of identity which are primarily inorganic social constructions;
  creations of authoritative bodies who impose meaning onto the natural
  mechanisms of individuation which may or may not produce similar results
  some of the time, or even most of the time."
    - i.e. hard-working laborers, patriotic citizens, loyal employees.
- Which of your identities holds the most personal attachment?

What is the teleological end point of conscious life? Why is evolution
implicit?
- Can non-cellular life ever become sentient?
- Do ever-complexifying biological hierarchies inevitably lead to human
  life or something similar?
- Is the synchronicity of instantiation and abstraction incidental?
    - i.e. does the form always correspond to the shape?
    - From where does the abstract impetus for complexity arise?
    - If the instatiation of life is expansion into new biological niches;
      what is its abstraction?
    - What niche does humanity fill, in both categories?
- Taking the idea of lower and higher planes, consider the example of this
  planet, and the entire universe.
    - How does the abstraction taken from humanity compare to the greater
      abstraction of the universe?
        - Perhaps it is more appropriate to compare humanity to the
          galactic abstraction.

Where does awareness go upon death of the body?
- What does it feel like to permanently lose all cognitive functioning?
    - Not just death, but through disability and impairment or Alzheimers
      and dementia.
- Can we assume that the death state is awareness unhindered?
    - If the unhinderence of dementia and disability, i.e. during 
      vegetative states, is itself a hindrance, what lies beneath them? 
- What happens to awareness when one enters deep states of meditation?
- What differentiates increasingly detached states of mind and death?
